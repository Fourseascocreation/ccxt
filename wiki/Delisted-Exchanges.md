# Delisted Exchanges

The CCXT library had integrated in the past and then delisted the following exchanges (might be incomplete list), due to different reasons:

- CoinEgg
- CoinFlex
- Cointiger
- SouthXchange
- TheRockTrading
...

It doesn't fully exclude the possibility to re-list them, but it will need solid actions made by those exchanges, to fix the wrongful actions they were delisted for.
